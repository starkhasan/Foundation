JSON :----------------------------------

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).It is light weight data-interchange format. It is easy for human to read and write.
JSON is a text format completely independent of language.

JSON syntax is basically considered as a subset of JavaScript syntex, It includes the following
=> Data is represented as name/value pair
=> curly braces hold object and each name is followed by colon(:) the name/value pairs are separated by comma(,)
=> Square brackets hold arrays and values are separated by comma (,)


JSON is built on two structure :-
=> A collection of namevalue pairs.In various language this is realized as an object records, struct, dictonary, hash table, keyed list, or Associative array
=> An ordered list value .This is realized as an array vector list sequence.


In JSON they take on these forms :

=>An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { left braces and ends with } right braces. Each name is followed by : colon the name value  pairs are separated by , comma.
=> An ordered list of values.In most language this is realized as an array vector list or sequence.


In JSON they take on these forms:

=> AN object is an unordered set of name/value. An object beigns with { left beigns and end with } right braces.
Each name is followed by : and the name/value pairs are separated by , comma.

=> An array is an ordered collection of values. An array beigns with [ left bracket and ends with ] right bracket. Values are separated by , comma.


=> A value can be a string in double quotes or a number , or true or false or null , or an object or an array. These structure can be nested.



Why use JSON :---------------------
Since the JSON format is text only it can easily be sent to and from a server and used as a data format by any programming laguage.
JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string written  in JSON format into native JavaScript Objects:
JSON.parse()
so we can receive data from a server in JSON format you can use it like any other JavaScript object.





JSON Android:--------------------------
There are three classes 
=> JSON Array	A dense indexed sequenced of values
=> JSONObject	A modifiable set of anme/value mapping
=> JSONStringer	Implements JSONObject#toString and JSONArray#toString.
=> JSONTokenizer	Parse a JSON(RFC 4627) encoded string into the corresponding object.

EXception
JSONException	Throw to indicate a problem with the JSON API.

Andorid provides four different classes to manipulate JSON data.These classes are JSONArray, JSONObject, JSONStringer and JSONTokenizer.

The fist step is to identify the field in the JSONdata in which you are intersted in.


JSon Elements:---------------------------
 AN JSON file consist of many components.Here is the table defining the component ofan JSON file and their description

Array[]	In JSON file square bracket [ represent a JSON array

Object{	In a JSON file curly bracket represent a JSON object

Key	A JSON object contains a key that is just a stinrg .Pairs of key/value make up a JSON object

Value	Each key has a value that could be string integer or double 


JSON Parsing:-------------------------------

1) For parsing a JSON object we will create an object of class JSONObject and specify a string containing JSON data to it

String in;
JSONObject reader=new JSONObject(in);

The last step is to parse the JSON . A JSON file consist of different obejct with the different key/value pair, SO JSONObject has a separate function for parsing each of the component of JSON file
