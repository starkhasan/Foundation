Does Android debug.keystore SHA1 is same for all machine?
You won't have a same debug key for each machine. ANy you won't have a same debug key for a machine because there is an expire for the debug key:


The self-signed certificate used to sign your APK for debugginh has an expiration date of 365 days from its creation date. When the certificate expires, you will get a build error.

To fix this problem simply delete the debug.keystore file. The file is stored in the following locations.

The next time you build and run the debug build type the build tools will regenerate a new keystore and debug key. Note that you must run your app, building alone does not regenerated the keystore and debug key.
