			<p class="details_para"><b>Power plant engineering </b>or power station engineering is a division of power engineering, and is defined as "the engineering and technology required for the production of central station electric power."[1] The field is focused on the generation of power for industries and communities, not for household power production. The field is an interdisciplinary field, using the theoretical base of both mechanical and electrical engineering.
