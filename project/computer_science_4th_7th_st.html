			<h3 class="heading">Software Testing</h3>
			<p class="details_para"><b>Software testing</b> is a process , to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirement or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect free in order to produce the quality product.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to <b> ANSI/IEEE 1059</b> standard - A process of analyzing existing and requirement conditions (i.e., defects) and to evaluate the features of  the software item.

				<h4 class="details_sub"><u>Why do we need to test Software?</u></h4>
				<p class="details_para">Software organisation are regularly getting failure report of their products and this number is increasing day by day. All of us would appreciate that it is extremely disappointing for the developers to receive such failure report The developers normally ask: how did these bugs escape unnoticed?It is a fact that software developers are experiencing failures in testing their coded programs and such situations are becoming threats to modern automated civilization.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot imagine a day without using cell phones, logging on to the internet, sending e-mails, watching television and so on. All these activities are dependent on software, and software is not reliable. The world has seen many software failures and some were even fatal to human life.</p>
				<h4 class="details_sub"><u>Some of the Sofware Failure</u></h4>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
					<li class="list_point">The Explosion of the Ariana 5 Rocket</li><p class="details_para1">The Ariane 5 rocket was designed by European Space Agency and it was launched on June 4,1996. It was an unmanned rocket and unfortunately exploded only after 40 seconds of its takeoff. The failure of Ariana 5 was caused by the complete loss of guidance and altitude information, this loss of information was due to specification and design errors in the software. 
					<li class="list_point">The Y2K Problem</li><p class="details_para1">It was simply the case of using two digits for the year instead of four digits. For instance 1965 was considered as 65.The developers could not imagine the problem of year 2000. What would happen on January 1, 2000? The last two digits i.e. 00 may belong to any century like 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, etc. The simple ignorance or a faulty design decision to use only the last two digits for the year resulted into the serious Y2K problem. Most of the software was re-tested and modified or discarded, depending on the situation.

					<li class="list_point">Failure of London Ambulance System</li><p class="details_para1">The software controlling the ambulance dispatch system of London collapsed on October 26-27, 1992 and also on November 4, 1992 due to software failures. The system was introduced on October 26, 1992. The London Ambulance Service was a challenging task that used to cover an area of 600 square miles and handled 1500 emergency calls per day. Due to such a failure, there was a partial or no ambulance cover for many hours. The position of the vehicles was incorrectly recorded and multiple vehicles were sent to the same location. Everywhere people were searching for an ambulance and nobody knew the reason for non-arrival of ambulances at the desired sites. The repair cost was estimated to be Â£9m.
