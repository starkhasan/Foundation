# Python does not have built in support for arrays but Python List can be used instead.
# However to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library like the numpy library
# Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable


cars = ['Ford', 'Volvo', 'BMW']
print(cars)

# Access the Elements of an Array
# you refer to an array element by refering to the index number

x = cars[0]

# Modify the value of the first array item
cars[0] = 'Toyota'

# use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in a array)

# you can use the append() method to add an element to an array
