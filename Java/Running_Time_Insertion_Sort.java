In a previous challenge you implemented the Insertion Sort algorithm. It is a simple sorting algorithm that works well with small
or mostly sorted data. However, it takes a long time to sort large unsorted data. To see why, we will analyze its running time.

Running Time of Algorithms

The running time of an algorithm for a specific input depends on the number of operations executed. The greater the number
of operations, the longer the running time of an algorithm. We usually want to know how many operations an algorithm will
execute in proportion to the size of its input, which we will call N.
What is the ratio of the running time of Insertion Sort to the size of the input? To answer this question, we need to examine the algorithm.

Analysis of Insertion Sort

For each element V in an array of  N numbers, Insertion Sort compares the number to those to its left until it reaches a lower
value element or the start. At that point it shifts everything to the right up one and inserts V into the array.

How long does all that shifting take?

In the best case, where the array was already sorted, no element will need to be moved, so the algorithm will just run through
the array once and return the sorted array. The running time would be directly proportional to the size of the input, so we can
say it will take N time.

However, we usually focus on the worst-case running time (computer scientists are pretty pessimistic). The worst case for
Insertion Sort occurs when the array is in reverse order. To insert each number, the algorithm will have to shift over that
number to the beginning of the array. Sorting the entire array of N numbers will therefore take 1+ 2+ ...+(N-1) operations, 
which is N(N-1)/2 (almost N^2/2). Computer scientists just round that up (pick the dominant term) to N^2 and say that
Insertion Sort is an "N^2" time algorithm.

What this means
The running time of the algorithm against an array of N elements is N^2. For 2N elements, it will be 4N^2. Insertion Sort can
work well for small inputs or if you know the data is likely to be nearly sorted, like check numbers as they are received by a bank.
The running time becomes unreasonable for larger inputs. 


Sample Input:-

2 1 3 1 2

Sample OutPut:-
