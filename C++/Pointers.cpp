//Pointers Assignment => As with any variable you may use a pointer on the right hand  side of an assignment statement to assign its value to another pointer.

/*Pointer to Pointer
It is form of miltiple indirection or chain or pointers. Normally a pointer contains the assress of variable.When we define a pointer to a pointer the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value.
