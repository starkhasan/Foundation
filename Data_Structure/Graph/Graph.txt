Application of Depth First Search :-
Depth First search is an algorithm fortraversing a graph
Following are the problem that use DFS as a building block

1) For a weighted graph DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.
2) Detecting cycle in a graph A graph has cycle is and only if we see a back-edge dring DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges.
 
3) path Finding (We can specilized the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z).



Application of Breadth First Search : -
1) Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree for unweighted graph.
2) Peer to peer Network
3) Crawlers in Search Engines
4) Social Networking Websites.
5) GPS Navigation Systems
5) Broadcast in Network
7) Garbage Collection
8) Cycle Detection in undirected graph.
